**Have you ever wondered which country has the most public holidays in the world?**

The *bubble world map* helps answer the question, with top 10 countries displayed. You can also zoom in any particular area with the lasso tool to see the number of public holidays in other countries.

The *heatmap* explores the month and day that have the most holidays. May seems to be the most festive month this year. For the exact number of holidays for each day of the month, you can hover the cursor above each of the tile.

There are some holidays that are widely enjoyed across the glove as shown in the *bar chart* and itâ€™s only to be expected that Christmas and New Year Day are one of those. You can also hover the cursor to bars to get more information about the top 10 holidays.
