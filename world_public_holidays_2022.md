## Column

**Have you ever wondered which country has the most public holidays in
the world?**

The **bubble world map** helps answer the question, with top 10
countries displayed. You can also zoom in any particular area with the
lasso tool to see the number of public holidays in other countries.

The **heatmap** explores the month and day that have the most holidays.
May seems to be the most festive month this year. For the exact number
of holidays for each day of the month, you can hover the cursor above
each of the tile.

There are some holidays that are widely enjoyed across the glove as
shown in the **bar chart** and itâ€™s only to be expected that Christmas
and New Year Day are one of those. You can also hover the cursor to bars
to get more information about the top 10 holidays.

**About the dataset**

The data was scraped from Office Holidays website and published on
Kaggle by user Kanawattanachai (2022). [Click to

*Notes: These visualisations do not take into account regional holidays
or festivals that are not public holiday*
